# ASSESSMENT 1: Career Readiness

The LEARN program focuses on readying our students for a career in technology. The job hunt is a daunting process that requires a lot of preparedness. Complete the following tasks to ensure progress in your professional development.

LinkedIn is the world's largest online professional networking community. An active presence on LinkedIn allows you to make professional connections, look for employment opportunities, connect with others who share your interests, and learn more about the tech industry.

- Submit your "about me" statement:
A veteran Aviation Mechanic of the U.S Navy who served for 8 years. My professional experience as an Aviation Mechanic that once was an apprentice and became a supervisor to more than 20 people is evidence of my dedication and great leadership skills. After serving my country I decided to transition into the Dental field. Just after I became a Registered Dental Assistant, I was able to gain the title Lead Dental Assistant.
The combined experience gave me military discipline, patience, supervisory skills and dental expertise. As I move forward with my career, I decided to learn and gain knowledge on how to code. I am currently enrolled at LEARN Academy and hoping to finish with a certificate.
